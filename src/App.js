            <p>
              I have a strong passion for collaboration and creativity. I feel there is something special about taking a concept and then turning it into a reality.

              In 2015 I completed a Web Development Certification
              at Delaware County Commuinty College learning web fundamentals like HTML, CSS, PHP and Bootstrap.
              I then started working in Web Development and as a Software Developer in May of 2016.
              In 2020 I completed the Front End and Mobile Development Certification at Nucamp working with REACT and REACT NATIVE.

              I have worked in Information Technology since 2007.
              Working in Web Development has been my favorite part of working in IT.
              Programming has allowed me to apply creative skills which I truly enjoy.

              I also combine my interests in art, music and gaming by working in Unity 3d doing their tutorials and eventually building my own games. This gave me a chance to incorporate sound, music, graphics and also some coding logic.
